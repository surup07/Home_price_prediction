# Home_price_prediction
The project aims at prediction of real-estate price using machine learning algorithm of Linear Regression. 
In this project firstly I have done data cleaning followed by outlier removal considering business logic.
After sucessfully implementing data cleaning and outlier removal I have applied Linear Regression for predicting price.
I have also used K-Fold cross validation technique to validate Linear Regression and obtained a test score of above 80% which is satisfactory.
To compare Linear Regression with Lasso Regression with Laso and Decision Tree I have used Grid Search Cv and obtained that Linear Regression gives the best score.
